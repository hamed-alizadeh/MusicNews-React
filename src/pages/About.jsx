        <p>Greetings! I'm Hamed Alizadeh, currently based in the charming city of Rome, Italy. With a passion for programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and C++, I've delved into the world of web development and machine learning. My expertise extends to technologies such as React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and SASS. Proficient in Git/GitHub and well-versed in the Linux operating system, I'm adept at numerical simulations using COMSOL.

Beyond my technical prowess, I thrive in collaborative environments and pride myself on being a self-starter. I believe in adaptability and value teamwork. Additionally, I possess strong presentation skills, allowing me to convey complex concepts with clarity.

I hold proficiency in English and Italian, both in written and spoken forms, and am proficient in Azeri and Persian as well. Alongside my academic pursuits, I've engaged in a series of enriching courses, including the 2023 Web Development Bootcamp, Ultimate C++ Series, Complete Python Mastery, and The Ultimate Git Course. Additionally, I've dived into the realms of machine learning with the "Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢" course.

My academic journey includes a publication in the 17th International Conference on Communications, Control, and Signal Processing (ICCCSP) held in Paris, France, where I presented a paper on face recognition under occlusion and EEG analysis of brain dynamics in children with language disorders.

For a deeper dive into my work and projects, feel free to explore my GitHub, LinkedIn, and CodeSandbox profiles linked below. Let's connect and embark on new, exciting endeavors together!
